# hello-world
Why bother?
I mean why bother describing a project called hello world?
A bit about myself. I call myself abilops. I am new to GitHub and excited to learn.
I hope this gives me the necessary skills needed to start working on major open source projects created either by me or others.
I like Hubot.
